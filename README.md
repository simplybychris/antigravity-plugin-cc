# agy — Antigravity CLI plugin for Claude Code

Use Google's [Antigravity CLI (`agy`)](https://antigravity.google/) from
inside Claude Code. Delegate tasks to the `agy:runner` subagent, run quick
prompts, or get a second-opinion code review — without leaving your editor.

This plugin is for Claude Code users who already use (or want to start using)
Antigravity and want a smooth way to call it from the workflow they already
have. Intentionally small: no Node runtime, no broker, no review-gate hook —
just Bash and `agy`.

## What you get

- **`/agy:setup`** — verify `agy` is installed and authenticated; can install
  it for you if it is missing.
- **`/agy:ask <prompt>`** — one-shot prompt through `agy -p`; returns the raw
  response.
- **`/agy:delegate <task>`** — hand a task to the `agy:runner` subagent.
  Supports `--background` for long jobs and `--model <name>` for routing.
- **`/agy:review [focus]`** — ask Antigravity to review your current
  `git diff`.
- **`agy:runner` subagent** — thin forwarding wrapper around the Antigravity
  CLI; available as `subagent_type: "agy:runner"` for programmatic
  delegation.

## Requirements

- **Claude Code** with plugin-marketplace support
  (`/plugin marketplace add …`).
- **Antigravity CLI (`agy`)** installed locally. `/agy:setup` can install it
  on first run.
- **Auth** for `agy`: either OAuth cached in the system keyring (after one
  interactive run of `agy`) or `ANTIGRAVITY_API_KEY` exported in your shell.
- **Bash** and **git** in `PATH`. macOS, Linux, or WSL.

## Install

In Claude Code, run these three slash commands in order:

```text
/plugin marketplace add simplybychris/antigravity-plugin-cc
/plugin install agy@antigravity-cc
/reload-plugins
```

Then verify everything is wired up:

```text
/agy:setup
```

If `agy` is missing, `/agy:setup` offers to install it via the official
installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://antigravity.google/cli/install.sh | bash
```

If `agy` is installed but not logged in, run `agy` once interactively in your
terminal to complete OAuth — or export `ANTIGRAVITY_API_KEY`.

## Usage

### Ask a quick question

```text
/agy:ask explain the difference between Go channels and Rust async in one paragraph
```

Returns Antigravity's response verbatim.

### Delegate a task to the `agy:runner` subagent

```text
/agy:delegate refactor the SQL queries in src/db/queries.go to use prepared statements
```

For long tasks, run in the background and let Claude Code notify you when it
finishes:

```text
/agy:delegate --background investigate why integration tests are flaky in CI
```

You can also delegate by talking to Claude:

```text
Ask agy to look at this file and suggest a simpler design.
```

The plugin's selection rules route through the `agy:runner` subagent
automatically.

### Review the current diff

Stage or make some changes, then:

```text
/agy:review
/agy:review focus on error handling and concurrency safety
```

### Pick a specific model

```text
/agy:delegate --model claude-sonnet fix the off-by-one in pagination
/agy:delegate --model gemini-3.1-pro write a high-coverage test for the cache layer
```

If no model is given, `agy` uses whatever is configured in
`~/.config/antigravity/config.toml` (or its global default).

## How it works

Under the hood, the plugin is a thin wrapper around your local `agy` install:

```
Claude Code  →  /agy:*  →  agy:runner subagent  →  agy-run.sh  →  agy -p "..."
```

- The plugin does **not** ship its own Antigravity runtime — it uses your
  local `agy` binary, your local auth, and your local config.
- The wrapper script
  ([`plugins/agy/scripts/agy-run.sh`](./plugins/agy/scripts/agy-run.sh))
  handles binary discovery, auth detection, and exit codes.
- The `agy:runner` subagent is a *forwarder*: it invokes the wrapper exactly
  once per request and returns Antigravity's output verbatim. No
  reinterpretation.

## Configuration

Antigravity itself reads `~/.config/antigravity/config.toml` and project-local
`AGENTS.md` / `GEMINI.md` files. This plugin doesn't override or shadow any
of that — drop config files where `agy` expects them and they'll be picked
up.

## FAQ

### Do I need an Antigravity subscription?

You need whatever account `agy` accepts: Google AI Pro, Ultra, Code Assist
Standard/Enterprise, or an enterprise GCP project. See the
[Antigravity docs](https://antigravity.google/docs/cli-overview) for details.

### Does this plugin send data anywhere other than what `agy` sends?

No. The plugin runs `agy` locally over a Bash wrapper. The wrapper only reads
filesystem paths and your shell environment. Your prompts go directly to
Google through `agy`'s normal channels.

### Can I keep using Antigravity outside this plugin?

Yes — the plugin uses your local install. Running `agy` directly in a
terminal keeps working exactly as before.

### Why a subagent instead of just a slash command?

Subagents in Claude Code can run in the background and report back when
finished. That is the workflow you want when you "hand this off to another
model and keep working" — which is the whole point of delegating to `agy`.

does the same thing for Codex. This plugin is intentionally smaller.
